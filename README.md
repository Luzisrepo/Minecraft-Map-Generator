## 🌍 About the Project

This **Minecraft Map Generator** is a web-based visualization tool that generates terrain maps using **Simplex Noise**, mimicking the early terrain style rendered by **Notch** in the classic days of Minecraft.

With built-in fake **shadows** and **fog**, it creates a soft atmospheric effect — giving the illusion of depth and lighting, all in the browser, no game engine required.
